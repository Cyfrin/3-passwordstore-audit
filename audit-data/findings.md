### [H-1] Storing the password on-chain makes it visible to anyone and no longer private.

**Description:** All data stored on-chain is visible to anyone, and can be read directly from the blockchain. The `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is intended to be a private variable and only accessed through the the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function, which is intended to be only called by the owner of the contract.

We show one such method of reading any data off chain below.

**Impact:** Anyone can read the private password, severly breaking the functionality of the protocol.

**Proof of Concept:** (Proof of Code)

The below test case shows how anyone can read the password directly from the blockchain.

1. Create a locally running chain

```bash
make anvil
```

2. Deploy the contract to the chain

```
make deploy
```

3. Run the storage tool

We use `1` because that's the storage slot of `s_password` in the contract.

```
cast storage <ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

You'll get an output that looks like this:

`0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014`

You can then parse that hex to a string with:

```
cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```

And get an output of:

```
myPassword
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Due to this, the overall architecture of the contract should be rethought. One could encrypt the password off-chain, and then store the encrypted password on-chain. This would require the user to remember another password off-chain to decrypt the password. However, you'd also likely want to remove the view function as you wouldn't want the user to accidentally send a transaction with the password that decrypts your password.

### [H-2] `PasswordStore::setPassword` is callable by anyone

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is set to be an `external` function, however the natspec of the function and overall purpose of the smart contract is that `This function allows only the owner to set a new password.`

```javascript
    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
@>      // @audit - There are no access controls here
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```

**Impact:** Anyone can set/change the password of the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

Add the following to the `PasswordStore.t.sol` test suite.

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```javascript
function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
    vm.prank(randomAddress);
    string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
    passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);
    vm.prank(owner);
    string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
    assertEq(actualPassword, expectedPassword);
}
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add an access control modifier to the `setPassword` function.

```javascript
if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
    revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
}
```

## <a id='L-01'></a>L-01. Initialization Timeframe Vulnerability



### Relevant GitHub Links

https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-10-PasswordStore/blob/main/src/PasswordStore.sol

## Summary

The PasswordStore contract exhibits an initialization timeframe vulnerability. This means that there is a period between contract deployment and the explicit call to setPassword during which the password remains in its default state. It's essential to note that even after addressing this issue, the password's public visibility on the blockchain cannot be entirely mitigated, as blockchain data is inherently public as already stated in the "Storing password in blockchain" vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Details

The contract does not set the password during its construction (in the constructor). As a result, when the contract is initially deployed, the password remains uninitialized, taking on the default value for a string, which is an empty string.

During this initialization timeframe, the contract's password is effectively empty and can be considered a security gap.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that during the initialization timeframe, the contract's password is left empty, potentially exposing the contract to unauthorized access or unintended behavior.

## Tools Used

No tools used. It was discovered through manual inspection of the contract.

## Recommendations

To mitigate the initialization timeframe vulnerability, consider setting a password value during the contract's deployment (in the constructor). This initial value can be passed in the constructor parameters.

### [I-1] The `PasswordStore::getPassword` natspec indicates a parameter that doesn't exist, causing the natspec to be incorrect

**Description:**

```javascript
    /*
     * @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
@>   * @param newPassword The new password to set.
     */
    function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {
```

The natspec for the function `PasswordStore::getPassword` indicates it should have a parameter with the signature `getPassword(string)`. However, the actual function signature is `getPassword()`.

**Impact:** The natspec is incorrect.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the incorrect natspec line.

```diff
-     * @param newPassword The new password to set.
```
